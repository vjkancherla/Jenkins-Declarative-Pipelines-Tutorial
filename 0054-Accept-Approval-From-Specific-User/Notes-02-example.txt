ACCEPT INPUT/APPROVAL ONLY FROM SPECIFIC USERS

USECASE: Only a specific user (a LEAD DEV or MANAGER) has the permissions to APPROVE INPUT

Note: Jenkins administrators are able to respond to the input regardless of the value of the submitter. Login as "devuser" to test.

                            message: 'Please approve deployment:',
                            parameters: [choice(name: 'deployChoice', choices: ['Yes', 'No'], description: 'Approve deployment?')],
                            submitter: 'AnManager,AnLeadDev',  // List of users allowed to submit
                            submitterParameter: 'approvedBy'       // This will capture the name of the user who approved
                        )

                        echo "Choice: ${userInput['deployChoice']}"
                        echo "Approved by: ${userInput['approvedBy']}"
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
    ------

    In the example above:
    [1] The submitter parameter in the input step is set to 'AnManager,AnLeadDev'. 
        This means only users AnManager or AnLeadDev will be allowed to approve or provide input.

    [2] The submitterParameter is used to capture the name of the user who provided the input or approval. 
        This can be helpful for logging or auditing purposes.

    Note: Jenkins administrators are able to respond to the input regardless of the value of the submitter. Login as "devuser" to test.
