===================
WHEN DIRECTIVE
===================

BeforeAgent():
----------------
    By default, the when directive is evaluated after the agent has been allocated for the stage. 
    If you use beforeAgent true, it tells Jenkins to evaluate the when condition before an agent is allocated. 
    This can be more efficient, as it avoids locking resources unnecessarily if the stage ends up being skipped.

    Example:
    ------
    stage('Example Deploy') {
        agent {
            label "some-label"
        }
        when {
            beforeAgent true
            branch 'production'
        }
        steps {
            echo 'Deploying'
        }
    }
    ------


BeforeInput():
----------------
    By default, the when condition for a stage will not be evaluated before the input, if one is defined. 
    However, this can be changed by specifying the beforeInput option within the when block. 
    If beforeInput is set to true, the when condition will be evaluated first, and the input will only be entered 
    if the when condition evaluates to true.

    Example:
    --------
    stage('Example Deploy') {
        when {
            beforeInput true
            branch 'production'
        }
        input {
            message "Deploy to production?"
            id "simple-input"
        }
        steps {
            echo 'Deploying'
        }
    }
    --------


BeforeOptions():
------------------
    By default, the when condition for a stage will be evaluated after entering the options for that stage, if any are defined. 
    However, this can be changed by specifying the beforeOptions option within the when block. 
    If beforeOptions is set to true, the when condition will be evaluated first, and the options will only be entered 
    if the when condition evaluates to true.

    Example:
    --------
    stage('Example Deploy') {
        when {
            beforeOptions true
            branch 'testing'
        }
        options {
            lock label: 'testing-deploy-envs', quantity: 1, variable: 'deployEnv'
        }
        steps {
            echo "Deploying to ${deployEnv}"
        }
    }
