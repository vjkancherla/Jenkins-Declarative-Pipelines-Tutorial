=============================
credentials() HELPER METHOD 
==============================
- The credentials() function in Jenkins is typically used to retrieve the value of a stored credential directl

- the "credentials()" helper method (used within the environment directive) supports secret text, username and password, 
  as well as secret file credentials.

EXAMPLE: Create environment variables From secrets
    ------
    pipeline {
        agent {
            // Define agent details here
        }
        environment {
            AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID     = credentials('jenkins-aws-secret-key-id')
            AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = credentials('jenkins-aws-secret-access-key')
        }
    }
    ------
    In this example, two secret text credentials are assigned to separate environment variables to access Amazon Web Services (AWS). 


EXAMPLE: Create environment variables for username and password credentials
    ------
    pipeline {
        agent {
            // Define agent details here
        }
        environment {
            BITBUCKET_COMMON_CREDS = credentials('jenkins-bitbucket-common-creds')
        }
    }
    ------
    In this example, username and password credentials are assigned to environment variables to access a Bitbucket repository in 
    a common account or team for your organization; these credentials would have been configured in Jenkins with the 
    credential ID jenkins-bitbucket-common-creds.

    This actually sets the following three environment variables:

    BITBUCKET_COMMON_CREDS - contains a username and a password separated by a colon in the format username:password.
    BITBUCKET_COMMON_CREDS_USR - an additional variable containing the username component only.
    BITBUCKET_COMMON_CREDS_PSW - an additional variable containing the password component only.


EXAMPLE: Create an environment variable for the kube-config secret-file credential
    ------
    pipeline {
        agent {
            // Define agent details here
        }
        environment {
            // The MY_KUBECONFIG environment variable will be assigned
            // the value of a temporary file.  For example:
            //   /home/user/.jenkins/workspace/cred_test@tmp/secretFiles/546a5cf3-9b56-4165-a0fd-19e2afe6b31f/kubeconfig.txt
        
            MY_KUBECONFIG = credentials('my-kubeconfig')
        }
        stages {
            stage('Example stage 1') {
                steps {
                    sh("kubectl --kubeconfig $MY_KUBECONFIG get pods")
                }
            }
        }
    }
