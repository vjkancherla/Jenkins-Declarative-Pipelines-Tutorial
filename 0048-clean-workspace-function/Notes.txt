================================
"cleanWs()" TO CLEAN WORKSPACE
================================
- The cleanWs function (or step) in Jenkins declarative pipelines is provided by the Workspace Cleanup Plugin. 

- Its primary purpose is to delete files and directories in the workspace, ensuring that you start with a clean slate 
  for your build or any other operations. 
  
- This can be particularly useful to prevent disk space issues on agents, to ensure that leftover files from previous builds 
  don't interfere with new builds, and to maintain general cleanliness and efficiency.

EXAMPLE:
    ------------
    pipeline {
        agent any

        stages {
            stage('Preparation') {
                steps {
                    cleanWs()
                }
            }

            stage('Build') {
                steps {
                    // Your build steps go here
                }
            }
        }

        post {
            always {
                cleanWs()
            }
        }
    }
    ------------

    In the above example, cleanWs is used at the start of the pipeline to ensure a clean workspace before the build begins. 
    
    Additionally, in the post block, it's used to clean the workspace after the build completes, regardless of whether the build was successful or failed.


Parameters:
--------------
The cleanWs step also accepts some parameters to provide flexibility in what gets deleted.

[1] deleteDirs: 
    By default, cleanWs deletes only files and not directories. If you set deleteDirs: true, it will also delete directories in the workspace.

    ----
    cleanWs(deleteDirs: true)
    ----

[2] patterns: 
    Allows you to specify file patterns to delete or to exclude from deletion.

    ----
    cleanWs(patterns: [
        includePattern: '**/*.tmp',   // Delete all .tmp files
        excludePattern: '**/important.log'  // But exclude important.log files
    ])
