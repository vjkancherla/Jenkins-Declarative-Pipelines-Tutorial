-USING "FAILFAST" TO FAIL THE WHOLE BUILD WHEN A PARALLEL TASK FAILS
	- The failFast option in Jenkins Pipeline's parallel directive controls how the pipeline behaves 
	  when one or more parallel branches (also known as stages) encounter a failure
	- By default, if you don't specify the failFast option, Jenkins Pipeline will wait for all parallel branches 
	  to complete before determining the overall result of the parallel block. 
	- If you set "failFast: true", the behavior changes. When any of the parallel branches fails, the parallel block 
	  will immediately mark the entire parallel block as failed, and the pipeline execution will be terminated f
	  or all remaining parallel branches.

	=====
	pipeline {
		agent any

		stages {
			stage('Parallel Stages') {
				parallel (failFast: true) {
					stage('Run DownStream Job-A') {
						steps {
							build(job: 'Pipeline-A-Job')
						}
					}
					stage('Run DownStream Job-B') {
						steps {
							build(job: 'Pipeline-B-Job')
						}
					}
				}
			}
		}
	}
