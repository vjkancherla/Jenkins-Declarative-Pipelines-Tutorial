SCHEDULING JOBS
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
- USING CRON
	- Cron is a time-based scheduler.
	- Cron triggers are useful when you want to run a job at specific, regular intervals, 
	  regardless of whether there are changes in your source code repository.
	- Cron triggers are not dependent on source code changes. 
	  They are purely time-based and execute according to the specified schedule.
	
	====
	pipeline {
		agent any
		
		triggers {
			cron('0 * * * *')  // This runs the pipeline every hour
		}
		
		stages {
			stage('Build') {
				steps {
				}
			}
		}
	}
	====

- USING POLLSCM
	- Poll SCM is time AND source code-driven. 
	- It run on a schedule and monitors your source code repository for changes and 
	  triggers the job or pipeline when it detects new commits or changes in the repository.

	====
	pipeline {
		agent any
		
		triggers {
			pollSCM('H * * * *')  // checks the repo for changes every hour
		}
		
		stages {
			stage('Build') {
				steps {
				}
			}
		}
	}
