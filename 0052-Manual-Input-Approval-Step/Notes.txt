MANUAL INPUT/APPROVAL STEP
============================
- Adds the Pipeline input step to wait for human input or approval. A basic Proceed or Abort option is provided in the stage view.

- The input step in Jenkins declarative pipelines is used to pause pipeline execution and prompt the user for input.

- This step pauses Pipeline execution and allows the user to interact and control the flow of the build. 
  Only a basic "proceed" or "abort" option is provided in the stage view.


EXAMPLE-1: Suppose you want to pause the pipeline and ask the user if they wish to proceed. You can use the input step as follows:
  ------
  stage('Approval') {
      steps {
          script {
              def userInput = input(message: 'Do you wish to continue?', ok: 'Proceed')
              echo "User decided to: ${userInput}"
          }
      }
  }
  ------


EXAMPLE-2: You can also ask the user to provide specific input using parameters:
  ------
  stage('Deploy') {
      steps {
          script {
              def userResponse = input(message: 'Choose a deployment environment:', parameters: [choice(name: 'ENV', choices: ['Development', 'Staging', 'Production'], description: 'Where do you want to deploy?')])
              echo "Deploying to: ${userResponse}"
          }
      }
  }

  ------


EXAMPLE-3: You can add a timeout to the input step to ensure that the pipeline doesn't wait indefinitely:
  ------
  steps {
    script {
      timeout(time: 2, unit: 'HOURS') {
          input(message: 'Do you wish to continue?', ok: 'Proceed')
      }
    }
  }
  ------

  
  EXAMPLE-4: Handling rejection
    If a user rejects the input (i.e., they do not approve), the pipeline will be aborted. However, you can catch this and handle it gracefully:
    -----
    script {
        try {
            input(message: 'Do you wish to continue?', ok: 'Proceed')
        } catch (e) {
            echo "User did not approve. Aborting."
            currentBuild.result = 'ABORTED'
            return
        }
    }
