MANAGING GLOBAL TOOLS
=======================
- Global Tool Configurations or "Jenkins Tools", is a feature in Jenkins that allows administrators to configure and 
   manage various tools and software installations that are required for building, testing, and deploying projects within 
   a Jenkins environment. These tools can include things like JDK (Java Development Kit) installations, version control systems 
   (e.g., Git, Subversion), build tools (e.g., Maven, Gradle), and more.

- Label Expressions: You can associate tools with specific build agents or nodes using label expressions. 
             This allows you to ensure that the appropriate tools are available on agents where specific jobs are executed.

- Environment Variables: Once tools are configured globally, Jenkins sets up environment variables that can be used within Jenkins jobs. 
            These variables allow you to reference the configured tool installations in your build scripts or commands.
