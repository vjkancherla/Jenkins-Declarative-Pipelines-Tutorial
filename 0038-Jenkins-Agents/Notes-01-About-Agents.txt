JENKINS AGENT
===============
- In Jenkins, an agent, also known as a "Jenkins agent" or "Jenkins slave," is a machine or environment configured to 
  execute jobs (builds, tests, deployments, etc.) on behalf of the Jenkins master server.


TYPES OF AGENTS
------------------
- JNLP (Java Web Start) Agent: 
    A common type of Jenkins agent is a JNLP agent.
    It is launched via Java Web Start and allows Jenkins to start and manage agents dynamically. 
    JNLP agents are suitable for various platforms.
    
- SSH Agent: 
    Jenkins can also use SSH to communicate with agents. 
    SSH agents are useful when you want to run builds on remote servers and prefer SSH connectivity for security reasons.

- Docker Agent: 
    Jenkins can launch Docker containers as agents, which provides a lightweight and isolated environment for builds. 
    Docker agents can be used to build and test in different environments.

- Windows Agent: 
    You can configure Windows-based agents for Jenkins if you have specific build requirements on Windows platforms.

- Custom Agents: 
    Jenkins allows you to create custom agents tailored to your needs using custom scripts or tools.
    Example: Kubernetes Pods


NODE/AGENT CONFIGURATION
---------------------------
- Each Jenkins agent, also referred to as a "node," is configured with a specific set of labels and capabilities. 
- Labels are used to tag agents, and jobs can be configured to run on agents with specific labels. 
  This allows you to control which agents execute specific types of jobs based on their capabilities.
